  This is th landing page with list of games in their different states, Active, upcoming or completed. You can click `See more` on th cards to get a popup with a map over the play area. From there you can join a game and view a more detailed page of the game.

## Admin page
An Administrator is the only one who can create and edit games and players. The Admins `Home Page` has an overview of all the games (active, upcoming and completed) similar to the landing page. The Admin can click on one of the game cards to access the `Admin Dashboard` for the particular game. The Admin Dashboard is where an Admin can add and edit missions, players, start/end/delete the game and keep track of game time and other statistics.
